# Pomodoro Clock

## Synopsis

This project is a jQuery powered Pomodoro timer app which starts at a default 25 minute session, and 5 minute break time. Both session and breaktimes are customizable. Each button and slider is mobile-touch optimized through jPunch, a jQuery plug-in.

You can check out the project at http://cabelin.com/pom_clock.

## Motivation

Have you ever wanted to have an optimal workflow with breaktime management? A proven way to be efficient is to follow the "pomodoro" technique where you take breaks at 25 minute intervals
